# Classifying-healthiness-of-supermarket-food-and-beverages-using-machine-learning

The main objective is to investigate the possibility to predict the health ranking by product name, brand, category, or nutrition data. The approach to this problem is a comparison of two classification methods: Rules-Based Classifier for text data and Random Forest classifier for numerical data. The Rule-based method applied to text data such as product name and brand. 

The presented solution for Rule-Based classifier is "proof of concept". For Classifier to be efficient, many more rules required. In the future work the restructuring of the rules required.

The current accuracy that classifier was able to reach is 60%. We did not assess the Rule-based classifier by classes, because we assigned rules without this attachment.
On average it took about 100 rules to increase accuracy by 11%. We can assume that to achieve accuracy of almost 100%, we will need at least 600 rules. However, to classify product in a real-life scenario we should take into consideration the limited use of some rules.
